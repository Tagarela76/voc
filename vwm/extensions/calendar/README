WHAT IS THIS ?
--------------
- It's an extensive calendar-script written in PHP and uses MySQL to store data.
- You can surf by day, week, month and by category you make ...
- The languages included are english, dutch, french, german, arabic, spanish,italian and korean.
- Further on there a lot of configurable vars in the config.inc.php file ... (colors, disable/enable ...)
- You can also give multiple days for one event ONLY in the admin-section, 
	! also, these events are automatically approved, so be carefull !
  
  to give in multiple events, do this:
    
     dd-mm-yyyy;dd-mm-yyyy' if day is one, type 01, same for month! without end-';'

  This may seem a bit bumpy and difficult or whatelse, but I'm not using select-boxes or something else, 
  because not every event takes place every day in a period like take a week or so. (eg. a course of IT every monday-night)

- also, there are some little language-words that need to be translated, because there are some little changes to the script
  if you look at the language-file, look at the bottom, it's indicated where the 'not-yet-all-translated-words' start.
  In some languages, one or two words aren't translated yet, so look out for them ..
- when you login into the admin-section, default login is 'god', default password is 'admin', be sure to delete
  this in the user-management en to create new user(s)

INSTALLATION
-------------
* unzip or untar the file
* Import the cal.sql in your mysqldatabase
  console : mysql -u username -p
	    create databasename; (if necessary)
	    use databasename;
	    source cal.sql;
	    quit;
  phpadmin : surf to the database and import the text file.	    

Open config.inc.php and change the variables.
* when you call the script, the index.php redirects to calendar.php (in the root-dir as well in the admin)
  so you can put the calendar in your 'root'-directory if you want this .. 
* Be carefull if you want to include your own header ..  you need the vars that are in cal_header.inc.php now !
